/*
 * Problem 9
 *
 * Given a list, split it into two sublists â€” one for the front half, and one
 * for the back half. If the number of elements is odd, the extra element
 * should go in the front list. So FrontBackSplit() on the list {2, 3, 5, 7,
 * 11} should yield the two lists {2, 3, 5} and {7, 11}. Getting this right for
 * all the cases is harder than it looks. You should check your solution
 * against a few cases (length = 2, length = 3, length=4) to make sure that the
 * list gets split correctly near the short-list boundary conditions. If it
 * works right for length=4, it probably works right for length=1000. You will
 * probably need special case code to deal with the (length <2) cases.
